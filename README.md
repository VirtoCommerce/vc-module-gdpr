# GDPR

## Overview

The GDPR module supplied by Virto is a tool allowing you to supply the customer with or remove their personal details, by anonymizing them, from your online store. It is perfectly in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that enables every individual to request their personal data stored on a website or demand to remove such at any time.

## Functional Requirements

For the GDPR module to work correctly, you must have installed the Virto Commerce Platform version 3.85.0 or above.
These modules are also required for GDPR to work, so make sure you have them on board:
+ VirtoCommerce.Customer 3.34.0 or above
+ VirtoCommerce.Orders 3.48.0 or above
